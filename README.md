# Graph-Implementation-CPP

This repository contains code for graph representations using adjacency list (GraphAdjList.cpp) and adjacency matrix (GraphAdjMatrix.cpp).
I have used dynamic memory allocation, which allows users to add/remove edges as required.

Running instructions on linux :

```
g++ GraphAdjList.cpp -o out
./out
```
